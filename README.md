# riot-api-challenge-2

This is a simple project made by 2 students.

It is not completly finished because of our lack of time, but it was a nice project where we both could learn a lot about `nodejs`, `mongodb` and `javascript` in general.

# Installation

Make sure you have `nodejs` `mongodb` and `npm` installed and running. 

`git clone` this repository

`cd` into this directory

`npm install && bower install`

Set an environment variable named `RIOT_API_KEY` with your API key.

Now you can preview this project with `grunt serve`

To make this code production ready do `grunt` and copy the data from the `dist` folder, also set an enviroment variable named `NODE_ENV` to `production`.
